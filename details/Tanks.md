# Tanks
This game was made using the engine created during the Graphics Programming 2 course. The original version of the engine, Overlord Engine, was very bare-bones and required the implementation of features using DirectX 11, HLSL and other frameworks/tools. I chose to recreate, with a twist, Wii Tanks as it was a challenging game to play and would offer me plenty of possibilities to add features.
