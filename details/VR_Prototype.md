# VR Prototype
A little VR demo developed for the HTC Vive when it first came out. The was done to see what the technology had to offer as well as see if the schools' computers could run the VR headset. This was the project that really got me interested in game dev and got me started on this journey.

This prototype was built with SteamVR and VRTK (Virtual Reality Toolkit). SteamVR was used for the specific headset provided, while VRTK was used for the multitude of functionality offered - interactable, locomotion, pointers, UI elements, etc.. VRTK would also facilitate other SDKs if the school would ever like to try using a different VR headset.
