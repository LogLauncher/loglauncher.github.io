My name is Struan Forsyth, from Switzerland and am currently in my 3rd year at Digital Arts & Entertainment finishing up my major in Game Development.

When I got my first computer I was fascinated with how it worked. This initial intrigue was what lead me to where I am now. While studying how to make desktop/mobile applications and websites I got the chance to try developing something for VR, as an avid gamer this was a great opportunity to develop for new hardware. This was the final push needed to get me to pursue a game dev related field of study. Over the last 2 years, I've learned a lot about game dev and all tasks that are needed to make a game. 

### Hobbies
Mountain biking, Web/Light novel reading, Gaming, VR, Gamedev
